# Delineating Settlement Outlines in Monduli, Tanzania
This research project focuses on delineating settlement outlines from openly accessible building footprint data, contributing to the Data for Good Movement by outputting vector polygons fully integratable with OSM.

Data Sources
Two sources of building footprints are used in this analysis:
Microsoft - downloadble from the “https://github.com/microsoft/Uganda-Tanzania-Building-Footprints”
OSM - downloadable from HOT: ttps://data.humdata.org/dataset/hotosm_tza_buildings”.
